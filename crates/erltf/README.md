# An Erlang Term Format (ETF) Serialization Library for Rust

This crate implements the Erlang Term Format (ETF) serialization format in Rust.

It supports encoding of Rust data structures into the ETF format as well as decoding of
binary ETF-encoded data obtained from an Erlang (or Elixir, or another BEAM-based language) node
into Rust data structures.
